This repository provides an implementation of the coding challenges procvided in the Coding Challenges blog [here](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/intro/)

This is an attempt to solve the coding challenges for building simple tools as well as my personal goal of learning go while building these simple projects.

The repository contains free exercises provided on John Calhoun's site [here](https://courses.calhoun.io/courses/cor_gophercises)
Solutions for the problems attempted are as below
